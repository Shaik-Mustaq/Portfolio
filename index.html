            <p>Hello! I'm Mustaq, a recent Electronics & Communication Engineering graduate with a strong passion for software engineering. During my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, JavaScript, and React.js, and I'm eager to apply these skills to real-world Projects.</p>
            <p>After completing my B.Tech, I enrolled in a comprehensive 9-month full-stack course where I honed my skills in front-end and back-end development. This experience allowed me to work on various Projects, including 'Women's Safety Using GIS,' which integrates emergency response features and a vibration sensor to detect falls, and a temperature sensor project using the Bolt IoT module that sends alerts when temperatures exceed set limits.</p>
            <p>I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can leverage my technical skills and academic background to contribute to innovative software development initiatives. My goal is to become a successful software engineer and eventually be my own boss. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to think creatively and solve complex problems.</p>
